graduate degree programs in Labor Studies and Urban Studies that are designed to meet the needs of working adults as well as traditional-age college students who seek to learn more about the challenges confronting poor and working-class populations in the workplace and in the community. It also collaborates with other units of CUNY to offer a range of college-credit programs designed to give workers the academic and technical skills they need for professional advancement. Its faculty includes distinguished scholars in the social sciences as well as expert practitioners in government, labor, and public service. In addition to its academic programs, SLU sponsors research; organizes forums and conferences; and publishes a national journal, <em>New Labor Forum: A journal of ideas, analysis, and debate.</em></p><p>The School of Labor and Urban Studies is an outgrowth of the Joseph S. Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies (JSMI). Named in honor of former CUNY Chancellor Joseph Murphy, JSMI was formerly affiliated to Queens College and more recently the CUNY School of Professional Studies. A leader in adult and worker education for nearly 35 years, it was established in collaboration with three New York City unions and began with 52 students. Today, the leaders of 26 labor and community organizations serve on its <a href="http://slu.cuny.edu/about/advisory-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advisory Board</a>. More than 1,200 adult and traditional-aged students are currently enrolled in undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs in Labor and Urban studies and in workforce development programs. The Joseph S. Murphy Institute will continue as an Institute within the new School, focusing on workforce development programs and housing the School’s Community Service unit, with its public programming, research, and publications.</p><p>The vision for this new School derives from its core values: access to education, diversity at every level, social justice, and equality for all. Its goals are to expand higher education opportunities for workers; prepare students who aspire to careers in public service and movements for social justice; promote civic engagement; provide leadership development for union and community activists; and help workers achieve greater economic security. Its perspective is unique, addressing the needs of its constituents while helping New York City and State fulfill their needs for a well-educated, highly skilled public and private workforce.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/faculty-handbook/Academic Calendar"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Academic Calendar</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/faculty-handbook/Academics"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Academics</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies. </div></div></div></footer></div>
