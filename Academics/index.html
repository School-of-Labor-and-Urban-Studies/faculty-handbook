Given its location, the department uses New York City as a laboratory to explore how cities—their politics and policies, economy, and social structure— impact workers, working-class communities, and other marginalized groups. In addition to offering students a strong theoretical background to urban debates, the department also provides students with a wide array of service-learning opportunities and the ability to apply their learning to the real world.</p><p>The Department of Urban Studies provides the following degrees and certificates:</p><ul><li>BA in Urban and Community Studies</li><li>MA in Urban Studies</li></ul><p>Certificate Programs:</p><ul><li>Certificate in Public Administration and Policy</li><li>Advanced Certificated in Public Administration and Policy</li><li>Certificate in Healthcare Leadership and Advocacy</li><li>Certificate in Leading Change in Healthcare Systems</li><li>Certificate in Community Leadership</li><li>Advanced Certificate in Community Leadership</li><li>Advanced Certificate in Workplace Democracy and Community Ownership</li></ul><p>Department Chair, Steven London, <a href="mailto:steven.london@slu.cuny.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steven.london@slu.cuny.edu</a></p><p>Administrative Coordinator, VACANT, 646-313-8476</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="program-expectations">Program Expectations<a class="hash-link" href="#program-expectations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We ask that you make your expectations for the course clear to students at the beginning of the term, both regarding what they will learn and how their learning will be evaluated during the course. Please review the course goals and objectives, evaluation criteria, and assignments on your syllabus.</p><p>Please identify, in the early weeks of class, methods of problem solving that you would encourage students to utilize if they are finding their learning experience is hindered in any way. This could relate to the content of the course materials or the classroom interactions. (e.g. too many reading assignments, reading too abstract, assignments too complicated, one student or a clique dominating classroom discussion being bothered by another student).</p><p>Students should be encouraged to see themselves as part of community of learners. Sometimes it is helpful to have the class generate a list of “guidelines” that would maximize the learning process for all students.</p><p>SLU is committed to providing a learning environment that enhances the dignity and worth of every member of its community. To this end, the community must endeavor to be free from discriminatory conduct of any kind.
