It also collaborates with other units of CUNY to offer a range of college-credit programs designed to give workers the academic and technical skills they need for professional advancement. Its faculty includes distinguished scholars in the social sciences as well as expert practitioners in government, labor, and public service. In addition to its academic programs, SLU sponsors research; organizes forums and conferences; and publishes a national journal, <em>New Labor Forum: A journal of ideas, analysis, and debate.</em></p><p>The School of Labor and Urban Studies is an outgrowth of the Joseph S. Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies (JSMI). Named in honor of former CUNY Chancellor Joseph Murphy, JSMI was formerly affiliated to Queens College and more recently the CUNY School of Professional Studies. A leader in adult and worker education for nearly 35 years, it was established in collaboration with three New York City unions and began with 52 students. Today, the leaders of 26 labor and community organizations serve on its <a href="http://slu.cuny.edu/about/advisory-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advisory Board</a>. More than 1,200 adult and traditional-aged students are currently enrolled in undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs in Labor and Urban studies and in workforce development programs. The Joseph S. Murphy Institute will continue as an Institute within the new School, focusing on workforce development programs and housing the School’s Community Service unit, with its public programming, research, and publications.</p><p>The vision for this new School derives from its core values: access to education, diversity at every level, social justice, and equality for all. Its goals are to expand higher education opportunities for workers; prepare students who aspire to careers in public service and movements for social justice; promote civic engagement; provide leadership development for union and community activists; and help workers achieve greater economic security. Its perspective is unique, addressing the needs of its constituents while helping New York City and State fulfill their needs for a well-educated, highly skilled public and private workforce.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="office-of-academic-affairs">OFFICE OF ACADEMIC AFFAIRS<a class="hash-link" href="#office-of-academic-affairs" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) supports the mission of the School of Labor and Urban Studies by striving to offer an educational environment that embraces access, diversity, and social justice. The Office of Academic Affairs promotes excellence in teaching, research, scholarship, professional service, and community engagement. Furthermore, the Office is responsible for supporting the work of the faculty, whose teaching, scholarship, and service are the foundation of the intellectual community that is the cornerstone of student success.</p><p>With a mission to remain faithful to the principles of the School of Labor and Urban Studies, the Office of Academic Affairs thus seeks to provide an environment in- and outside the classroom that is resolutely committed to creating a unique partnership between the City University of New York, organized labor, worker centers, and community-based organizations. This is the promise offered to students: If you have the ability and training to see the value of education and apply it, you will find the creative power to directly engage the world. And this will have a direct bearing on all you wish to accomplish.</p><p>Interim Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, Gladys Palma de Schrynemakers, <a href="mailto:gschryne@slu.cuny.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gschryne@slu.cuny.edu</a>

Given its location, the department uses New York City as a laboratory to explore how cities—their politics and policies, economy, and social structure— impact workers, working-class communities, and other marginalized groups.

This could relate to the content of the course materials or the classroom interactions. (e.g. too many reading assignments, reading too abstract, assignments too complicated, one student or a clique dominating classroom discussion being bothered by another student).</p><p>Students should be encouraged to see themselves as part of community of learners. Sometimes it is helpful to have the class generate a list of “guidelines” that would maximize the learning process for all students.</p><p>SLU is committed to providing a learning environment that enhances the dignity and worth of every member of its community. To this end, the community must endeavor to be free from discriminatory conduct of any kind.

One excellent guide referred to below is John Bean’s <em>Engaging Ideas</em> (San Francisco: Jossey Bass, 2001), but there are many useful teaching tips available on the web as well.</p><p><strong>Challenges in Online Teaching</strong>
<strong>Levels of Student Preparedness </strong></p><ol><li><p>Students frequently lack basic knowledge of the topics taught (general background).</p></li><li><p>Students frequently lack basic knowledge of or have little practice in central academic skills – writing and research related, but also basic study skills, including doing work in a timely manner.</p></li><li><p>How to work with ESL students and give them the support they need.</p></li><li><p>Balancing between helping students who need it (in any of the above categories) and continuing to challenge academically proficient students.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Grading</strong></p><ol><li><p>Uncertainty about common standards for each program</p></li><li><p>Balancing between improvement over the course of the term and final product</p></li><li><p>How to grade written work when written expression is subpar</p></li></ol><p><strong>Classroom Dynamics:</strong></p><ol><li><p>How to work with difficult students whose contributions tend to derail the class</p></li><li><p>How to break up three-hour classes to maintain student engagement</p></li></ol><p><strong>Some Suggestions</strong></p><p>Contact Michael Rymer, <a href="mailto:michael.rymer@slu.cuny.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">michael.rymer@slu.cuny.edu</a> to introduce students to skills specialists. Consider putting students into breakout groups to discuss specific assignments and/or skill problems, and/or encourage students to come to the How-To workshops that are offered each semester.</p><p>Recommend immersion for ESL students. The best way for English learners to learn English is to immerse themselves in English-speaking environments. They should read the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (to which subscriptions are free with a CUNY email); they should watch English- language TV; they should join discussion groups; they should read all research materials in English. If they have kids, they should read to them in English. Reading and re-reading children’s books is a useful activity for ESL learners.</p><p>It is suggested that faculty conduct an assessment of student background knowledge and writing skills at the beginning of the semester to flag students who may need more help. Based on that assessment, students can be gently advised that they may have more work to do to keep up with the class. To facilitate this work, faculty can send them to Michael Rymer, meet with them individually, and/or suggest background reading materials on the subject of the class. Faculty should also let advisers and academic directors know about students who have major skill or background knowledge deficits.</p><p>Other suggestions:</p><ul><li><p>Give students the chance to write in class, in response to readings, presentations, or class discussions. Quiet students will speak more freely if they’ve already written something – or at the very least the students will have some record of their thoughts and questions.</p></li><li><p>Give students reading lists of supplemental background materials. Encourage them to organize study groups if need be.</p></li><li><p>Give mini-lectures about basic skills and provide examples of what will be involved in assignments, i.e. how to write a summary, develop a thesis, include citations, write a topic sentence, develop an outline, etc. Review common grammar problems, the difference between facts and opinions, developing an argument, etc. This is especially useful when a project has been assigned to the class, and when work is being returned to the class – both of which tend to focus student attention.</p></li></ul><p>Provide lots of opportunities for students to speak in classes – to each other in groups, in pairs, or in the class as a whole. This is especially useful as preparation for writing assignments, or for tests – talking, like writing, helps students process information and increases their fluency with ideas – but with lower stakes than writing.</p><ul><li><p>Meet with students individually at least once during the semester to discuss their written work. This could be done in lieu of one class session, or in extended office hours.</p></li><li><p>Consider limiting the amount of reading assigned so as to work with the students on the remaining readings more closely. Conduct close readings in class with difficult texts.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Grading</strong></p><p><strong>*<!-- -->Participate in a norming session</strong> with fellow faculty members. What do they consider to be A’s, B’s, C’s, F’s? Compare and contrast.</p><p><strong>*<!-- -->Have clear expectations ahead of time,</strong> and express them to students – for the class, and for all assignments. Include these expectations in the syllabus and in the specific assignments.</p><p><strong>*<!-- -->Use minimal marking.</strong> Studies show that students do not progress if their papers are marked up and all of their mistakes corrected. Indicate patterns that they need to look for, or underline WHERE the mistake is. But they should be responsible for finding it – ultimately, it’s on them.</p><p><strong>*<!-- -->Assign work in stages</strong> so that feedback can be given along the way. Have students hand in notes, an annotated bibliography, a thesis, a rough draft, a work plan, an outline, the first few pages, the core analysis without intro or conclusion, answers to questions that prepare them for the final assignment, or any combination of the above before the final paper is due. Have at least three stages: thesis and plan, almost finished draft, and final draft. More stages better.</p><p><strong>*<!-- -->Use peer reviews</strong> for some of the early writing. Students can help each other make their ideas and language clearer, and occasionally can help with deeper content as well. This can be done in class or electronically.</p><p>*<strong>*<!-- -->Respond initially to ideas and the quality of their support. Wait till later drafts for writing issues of organization or error. If students are encouraged to sharpen their ideas, their writing often gets better. Bad writing is very often a result of unclear thinking. If they can figure out what they’re trying to say, the writing will often get better. <!-- -->*<!-- -->*</strong></p><p><strong>*<!-- -->Develop a grading rubric.</strong> One that works nicely is explaining that meeting (specified) minimum requirements brings you to a “B” level paper. Failing to meet minimums assures a C level or below, and exceeding minimums gives you higher grades. Faculty must figure out for themselves what the minimum is.</p><p>For example, this is from John Bean<em>, Engaging Ideas</em>, p. 264:</p><p><strong>How I Assign Letter Grades</strong>
In grading “thesis papers,” I ask myself the following set of questions:</p><ol><li><p>Does the paper have a thesis?</p></li><li><p>Does the thesis address itself to an appropriate question or topic?</p></li><li><p>Is the paper free from long stretches of quotations and summaries that exist only for their own sake and remain unanalyzed?</p></li><li><p>Can the writer produce complete sentences?</p></li><li><p>Is the paper free from grammatical errors?</p></li><li><p>If the answers to any of these questions is no, I give the paper some kind of “C”.</p><p>[Most, something lower. If “yes” so far, then:]</p></li><li><p>How thoughtful is the paper? Does it show real originality?</p></li><li><p>How adequate is the thesis?</p><p>[Relevance to topic, responds to problem, interesting, complex]</p></li><li><p>How well organized is the paper? Does it stick to the point? Does every paragraph contain a clear topic sentence?</p><p>[Transitions; conclusion]</p></li><li><p>Is the style efficient, not wordy or unclear?</p></li><li><p>Does the writing betray any special elegance?</p></li></ol><p>Above all, can I hear a lively, intelligent, interesting human voice as I read this paper? Depending on my answers to such questions, I give the paper some kind of A or some kind of B grade.</p><p><strong>*<!-- -->Give students examples</strong> of what an “A” paper looks like, a “B” paper, a “C” paper and an “F” paper.</p><p><strong>*<!-- -->Don’t spend a ton of time on final drafts!</strong> Comment and respond when students still have time to respond to what is being suggested. (See advice about staging assignments, above.)</p><p><strong>Classroom Dynamics</strong>
Too much counterproductive participation may require active intervention. Some general tips:</p><ol><li><p>Always be respectful and professional.</p></li><li><p>Work with difficult students one-on-one before taking them on in the classroom. Talk to them to see what kinds of issues they might be having. Explain to them, one on one, why they won’t be called on very often, or suggest more effective ways for them to participate. Follow up if the problem persists. If, for any reason, a faculty member doesn’t feel comfortable meeting with a student, reach out to the department chair or advisor, as one of the two can be present during the meeting.</p></li><li><p>Be as honest as possible about the problems with the student, within the bounds of respect and professionalism. Present the class with clear expectations about what constructive participation looks like. It’s easier to cut off students if clear expectations are in place.</p></li><li><p>Let the department chairs and advisors know about any very problematic students.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="full-time-faculty">FULL-TIME FACULTY<a class="hash-link" href="#full-time-faculty" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guidelines-for-evaluation-reappointment-promotion--tenure">GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION, REAPPOINTMENT, PROMOTION &amp; TENURE<a class="hash-link" href="#guidelines-for-evaluation-reappointment-promotion--tenure" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>Evaluation Standards for Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure </strong>
The evaluation of a faculty member for reappointment, promotion and tenure, shall be based on the candidate’s total academic performance with special attention to teaching effectiveness, scholarship, and service activity outlined in the current curriculum vitae, supporting materials, letters of evaluation (required for appointment, promotion and tenure but not reappointment), and annual evaluations. For appointment, tenure and promotion purposes, examples of the candidate’s work are required.</p><p><strong>Annual Faculty Evaluation &amp; Reappointment</strong>
At least once each year, members of the SLU faculty other than tenured full professors shall have an annual evaluation conference with their department chair, a member of the department assigned by the department chair, or the School’s Personnel and Budget (P&amp;B) committee. The annual evaluation should be scheduled no later than March 1st. At the conference, the faculty member&#x27;s total academic performance, professional progress toward promotion and or tenure for that year and cumulatively shall be reviewed. In cases where the department chair is evaluated or is the subject of reappointment, promotion or tenure, the SLU associate dean for academic affairs will designate a full professor on the P&amp;B committee to conduct the department chair’s evaluations.</p><p>Within ten (10) working days of the annual evaluation conference, the department chair or designee shall prepare a record of the discussion in memorandum form for inclusion in the faculty member&#x27;s personal file, and a copy of the memorandum shall be given to the faculty member. If the overall evaluation is unsatisfactory, the memorandum shall so state.</p><p>The faculty member shall sign and date an acknowledgement of receipt, may provide a response for inclusion in their file and, if the evaluation is unsatisfactory, may add to the memo a request to appear before the appropriate SLU P&amp;B Committee.</p><p>Annual evaluations and any responses shall be included in the faculty member’s personal file. Annual evaluations should be forwarded to the P&amp;B Committee for its review no later than the beginning of the annual leave period of each year.</p><p>Assuming a satisfactory review, the P&amp;B committee shall prepare an annual letter of reappointment for each faculty member that shall be forwarded to the SLU Dean for appropriate action and receipt by the faculty member of notification of said action from the Dean no later than December 1st (except for the first reappointment notification which shall be no later than April 1st of the year of the first annual appointment).</p><p><strong>Pre-Tenure Review </strong>
The Pre-Tenure Year Review Policy is to ensure that each tenure-track faculty member has adequate guidance on the progress he/she is making towards meeting the standards for tenure at SLU. To this end the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs shall review each such faculty member at the end of his or her third year of service.</p><p>The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs shall review the personal personnel file of each untenured tenure-track faculty member in the spring of his/her third year of service, following the annual evaluation conducted pursuant to the PSC/CUNY collective bargaining agreement. Thereafter, the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs shall meet with the chairperson of the faculty member’s department to discuss the faculty member’s progress. After that meeting, the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs shall prepare a memorandum to the department chairperson regarding the faculty member’s progress toward tenure and setting forth recommendations for any additional guidance to be provided to the faculty member.</p><p>The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs’s memorandum shall be provided to the faculty member and discussed with him/her by the department chairperson. The department chairperson will report to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs on the substance of the meeting. At the discretion of the faculty member, the faculty member may meet and discuss with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs or jointly the Department Chair and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs the content of the</p><p>Associate Dean for Academic Affairs’s memorandum. Following the meeting(s), the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs may, where appropriate, attach an addendum to the memorandum based on the participation of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the meeting or the department chairperson’s report of the meeting to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. In accordance with the procedures set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the University and the Professional Staff Congress, the faculty member shall be asked to initial the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs’s memorandum and addendum, if any, before it is placed in his/her personnel file, and the faculty member shall have the right to include in his/her personnel file any comments he or she has concerning the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs’s memorandum.</p><p><strong>Promotion and Tenure Procedures</strong>
Faculty members seeking promotion or tenure shall consult their department chair by the end of the fall semester before the year they are to be considered.</p><p>By March 1st of the sixth appointment year of a faculty member seeking tenure and by March 1st of a faculty member seeking promotion, faculty members shall submit a current curriculum vitae with supporting material (the tenure and/or promotion file) to the department chair for review by the P&amp;B Committee. The chair or designee may meet with the candidate to suggest revision to the materials before sharing them with the P&amp;B Committee.</p><p>By March 1st of the sixth appointment year of a faculty member seeking tenure and by March 1st of a faculty member seeking promotion, faculty members shall submit to the Chairperson lists of</p><p>references as outlined below. The Chair and the SLU P &amp; B shall finalize the list of reviewers as outlined below and send out the tenure and/or promotion file to the reviewers by March 31st.</p><p>The SLU P &amp; B shall meet during the following September and make a decision by September 30th. The decision is then forwarded to the SLU Dean who must notify the candidate of the Dean’s final decision by December 1st.</p><p><strong>Letters of Recommendation (required for appointment, promotion or tenure)</strong>
All letters of recommendation should be solicited from scholars or specialists in the candidate’s field from outside The City University of New York, who hold a rank at least equivalent to the action requested. For example, for a promotion to Associate Professor, reviewers should be at the rank of Associate or Full Professor. None of the reviewers should be or have been a collaborator, co-author or dissertation advisor of the candidate, except in cases of appointment of an assistant professor without tenure.</p><p>The candidate for promotion and/or tenure shall select two reviewers to be contacted and the department chairperson shall select 3 reviewers to be contacted, in consultation with the SLU P &amp;</p><p>B. Additional evaluation letters beyond the minimum number may be included.</p><p>All recommendation letters should contain a statement describing how the candidate is known to the evaluator; which of the candidate&#x27;s writings have been read by the evaluator, and how the candidate&#x27;s work is judged relative to the most important work currently being done in the field.</p><p><strong>Academic Appeals Process</strong>
The department chair may share the results of SLU P&amp;B committee’s evaluation, but not the specific vote count, with the faculty candidate.</p><p>A negative decision by the P&amp;B Committee may be appealed within 30 calendar days of notification to an appeals committee composed of the Chair of the P &amp; B Committee and two faculty members not on the P &amp; B elected by the Governing Council to hear the appeal of a negative decision and to make a recommendation that it sends to the SLU Dean.</p><p>If the Dean makes a negative determination of the faculty member’s evaluation for promotion or tenure, the faculty member has the right to appeal that negative decision and subsequently has the right to receive reasons for that negative determination.</p><p>All final appointment, reappointment, promotion and tenure decisions are made by the CUNY Board of Trustees on recommendation of the Chancellor. Tenure decisions take effect the following September 1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Promotion decisions take effect in late August, the day after the faculty-leave period ends in that year, which is the date of reappointment.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multiple-positions">MULTIPLE POSITIONS<a class="hash-link" href="#multiple-positions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>All full-time faculty members, including faculty members on leaves other than long-term disability leave, must fill out the <a href="https://www2.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/administration/offices/hr/MultiplePositionForm-12-10-18-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple Position Report</a> each semester and update the form if changes occur during the semester. The form requires the faculty member to detail activities within and outside of CUNY that are in addition to his/her regular, full-time employment at the college.

This statement both normalizes the accommodation process and help to create a positive and welcoming environment for students with disabilities. The statement also creates a collaborative model for determining and implementing legally mandated accommodations and serves as a reminder to students who need the accommodations that these arrangements need to be made. Below are a few recommended statements you may choose to use or you may consult your campus office of disability services for additional guidance.</p><p>Sample Syllabus Statement:</p><ol><li><p>Any student who feels that he may need an accommodation based upon the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his specific needs.
